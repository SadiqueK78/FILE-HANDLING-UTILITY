DESCRIPTION:-This Java project is a simple, menu-driven program that allows users to perform various file operations such as reading, writing, modifying, and deleting content in a text file. It offers an interactive interface for users to manage file contents efficiently.

Features:
Write to File: Allows users to append text to an existing file.
Read from File: Displays the contents of the file.
Modify File: Overwrites the entire file with new content.
Modify Specific String in File: Replaces a specific string with a new string throughout the file.
Delete Line from File: Removes a specific line from the file.
Menu-Driven Interface: The program provides a simple menu to choose various operations.
Tools and Technologies:
Java: Used for file handling and user interaction.
VS Code: The development environment used for writing and debugging the code.
How It Works:
The program starts by creating a text file (newfile.txt) with initial content.
Users can select operations from a menu to:
Write new content to the file.
Read the file contents.
Modify specific text or delete lines.
The program runs until the user chooses to exit.
How to Use:
Compile and run the FileCreating.java class to initialize the file with content.
Run FileMenu.java to interact with the menu and perform file operations.
Future Enhancements:
Search Functionality: Add a search feature to find text in the file.
Error Handling: Improve error handling for file-related issues.
Backup Option: Allow users to create backups before modifying files.
This project is a simple yet effective way to learn and practice file operations in Java.
